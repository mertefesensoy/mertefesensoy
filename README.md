### Now

- Building [The Open Memory Initiative (OMI)](https://github.com/The-Open-Memory-Initiative-OMI/omi) -- an open, reproducible DDR4 UDIMM reference design.
- Deepening expertise in real-time operating systems (FreeRTOS) and embedded architecture.
- Designing **BeeLink CN**, a 5G-enabled health platform for remote patient monitoring (concept stage).

---

### Featured Projects

#### [The Open Memory Initiative (OMI)](https://github.com/The-Open-Memory-Initiative-OMI/omi)

> Open hardware project: transparent, reproducible DDR4 UDIMM module design.

- Documentation-first, staged methodology -- architecture decisions, block decomposition, schematic capture -- with every design choice explained and reviewable.
- Power/PDN, address/command/clock, and data byte-lane schematics complete. SPD configuration and validation platform currently in progress.

#### BeeLink CN (5G Health Platform)

> Concept-stage platform for accessible remote patient care. *Repo coming soon.*

- Scope: home patient monitoring (bedridden/home-care), AI-based triage and diagnosis support, automatic ambulance dispatch on emergencies, real-time hospital bed occupancy tracking for routing.
- Planned interfaces: web dashboard for hospitals/admins, mobile app for patients/carers, process-tracking backend.

#### [valentine-pomodoro](https://github.com/mertefesensoy/valentine-pomodoro)

> React Native + Expo + TypeScript Pomodoro timer with a Valentine aesthetic.

- Timestamp-based timer (no drift when backgrounded), idempotent completion handling, event-driven state management. Background notifications on both iOS and Android via EAS.
- Fully offline, zero data collection. All data persists locally through AsyncStorage.

#### [FreeRTOS_Demo](https://github.com/mertefesensoy/FreeRTOS_Demo)

> RTOS learning demos running on a Windows simulator -- no physical hardware required.

- Five concurrent tasks with priority-based scheduling, mutex-protected circular buffers, deferred ISR processing via direct task notifications, and an interactive console.
- Includes a FreeRTOS+UDP networking demo (echo server/client, CLI over UDP) and a deliberate `USE_MUTEX` toggle that demonstrates race conditions when synchronization is disabled.

### Collaboration

**OMI** is actively looking for contributors. Start with the [issues page](https://github.com/The-Open-Memory-Initiative-OMI/omi/issues) for concrete topics (driver implementations, documentation reviews) or open a [discussion](https://github.com/The-Open-Memory-Initiative-OMI/omi/discussions) for architecture questions. Please review the existing docs and CONTRIBUTING.md before submitting.

For **BeeLink CN** architecture discussion or general inquiries, reach out via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mertefesensoy).

Open to issues, pull requests, and documentation reviews across any of my repos.

### BeeLink CN -- Repo Plan

Planned repository structure for when the 5G Health Platform moves to implementation.

**Suggested naming:** `beelink-cn` (monorepo) or the multi-repo layout below.

| Repo | Purpose | Key folders / sections |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `beelink-docs` | Architecture specs, API contracts, user guides | `architecture/`, `api-specs/`, `guides/` |
| `beelink-mobile` | Patient/carer mobile app | `src/`, `assets/`, `e2e/`, platform configs |
| `beelink-web` | Hospital/admin dashboard | `src/components/`, `src/pages/`, `public/` |
| `beelink-core-api` | Backend services, business logic, AI triage | `src/routes/`, `src/services/`, `src/models/`, `migrations/` |
| `beelink-infra` | Deployment, CI/CD, container orchestration | `docker/`, `k8s/`, `.github/workflows/`, `terraform/` |

Each repo README should include: project purpose, local setup, environment variables, testing instructions, and contribution guidelines.

<summary><strong>How I work</strong></summary>

- Documentation is not an afterthought. Design decisions are recorded before implementation begins.
- Correctness over speed -- especially in embedded and hardware-adjacent domains where silent failures are costly.
- Open-source toolchains and reproducible environments whenever possible.
