### Now

- Building [The Open Memory Initiative (OMI)](https://github.com/The-Open-Memory-Initiative-OMI/omi) -- an open, reproducible DDR4 UDIMM reference design.
- Deepening expertise in real-time operating systems (FreeRTOS) and embedded architecture.
- Designing **BeeLink CN**, a 5G-enabled health platform for remote patient monitoring (concept stage).

---

### Featured Projects

#### [The Open Memory Initiative (OMI)](https://github.com/The-Open-Memory-Initiative-OMI/omi)

> Open hardware project: transparent, reproducible DDR4 UDIMM module design.

- Documentation-first, staged methodology -- architecture decisions, block decomposition, schematic capture -- with every design choice explained and reviewable.
- Power/PDN, address/command/clock, and data byte-lane schematics complete. SPD configuration and validation platform currently in progress.

#### [BeeLink CN (5G Health Platform)](https://github.com/BeeLink-CN)

> Concept-stage platform for accessible remote patient care. *Repo coming soon.*

- Scope: home patient monitoring (bedridden/home-care), AI-based triage and diagnosis support, automatic ambulance dispatch on emergencies, real-time hospital bed occupancy tracking for routing.
- Planned interfaces: web dashboard for hospitals/admins, mobile app for patients/carers, process-tracking backend.

#### [valentine-pomodoro](https://github.com/mertefesensoy/valentine-pomodoro)

> React Native + Expo + TypeScript Pomodoro timer with a Valentine aesthetic.

- Timestamp-based timer (no drift when backgrounded), idempotent completion handling, event-driven state management. Background notifications on both iOS and Android via EAS.
- Fully offline, zero data collection. All data persists locally through AsyncStorage.

#### [FreeRTOS_Demo](https://github.com/mertefesensoy/FreeRTOS_Demo)

> RTOS learning demos running on a Windows simulator -- no physical hardware required.

- Five concurrent tasks with priority-based scheduling, mutex-protected circular buffers, deferred ISR processing via direct task notifications, and an interactive console.
- Includes a FreeRTOS+UDP networking demo (echo server/client, CLI over UDP) and a deliberate `USE_MUTEX` toggle that demonstrates race conditions when synchronization is disabled.

### Collaboration

**OMI** is actively looking for contributors. Start with the [issues page](https://github.com/The-Open-Memory-Initiative-OMI/omi/issues) for concrete topics (driver implementations, documentation reviews) or open a [discussion](https://github.com/The-Open-Memory-Initiative-OMI/omi/discussions) for architecture questions. Please review the existing docs and CONTRIBUTING.md before submitting.

For **BeeLink CN** architecture discussion or general inquiries, reach out via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mertefesensoy).

Open to issues, pull requests, and documentation reviews across any of my repos.

### OMI -- Repository Organization

Open Memory Initiative follows a structured, documentation-first approach to hardware design.

**Repository:** [The-Open-Memory-Initiative-OMI/omi](https://github.com/The-Open-Memory-Initiative-OMI/omi)

| Section | Purpose | Key contents |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Root docs | Project governance and roadmap | `CHARTER.md`, `SCOPE_V1.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LEARNING_ROADMAP.md` |
| `docs/` | Comprehensive educational material (10+ chapters) | System context, DRAM fundamentals, DDR4 protocol, DIMM anatomy, signal integrity, power delivery, topology, schematic capture, validation, layout guidelines |
| `design/` | Live design artifacts and decisions | Design assumptions, constraints, implementation files, power analysis, signal mapping, topology definitions |
| Issues | Active design discussions and task tracking | Architecture decisions, component selection, validation methods, open questions |

The project is structured around transparent engineering: every design choice is documented **before** implementation. Contributors can join at any stage -- from reviewing design decisions in issues, to writing documentation, to implementing hardware validation tools.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/The-Open-Memory-Initiative-OMI/omi/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [issues page](https://github.com/The-Open-Memory-Initiative-OMI/omi/issues) to get started.

<summary><strong>How I work</strong></summary>

- Documentation is not an afterthought. Design decisions are recorded before implementation begins.
- Correctness over speed -- especially in embedded and hardware-adjacent domains where silent failures are costly.
- Open-source toolchains and reproducible environments whenever possible.
